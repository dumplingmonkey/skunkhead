# Sample document

This is a sample document written for the tutorial [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Text Editor to Be Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/text-editor) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/). It's written in [Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a plain-text format that's both easy to read and easy to convert to HTML. In later tutorials, we'll use Markdown for making README files designed to give a quick overview of a project's contents.

After finishing LEGTBD, you'll know enough Git to be dangerous. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in your project, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate with programmers and other users of Git.  Or not, I don't know.
